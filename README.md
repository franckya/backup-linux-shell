# backup-linux-shell

This script creates a tarball (a compressed archive file) with the current date and time in the filename. The tarball will contain all the files in the src_dir directory. You can adjust the src_dir and backup_dir variables to specify the directories that you want to use for the source and backup, respectively.

You can run this script by making it executable and then running it, like this:

`` chmod +x backup.sh``
``./backup.sh``
